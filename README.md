This was based on a [CodePen](https://codepen.io/vlemoine/pen/xxKYPav) I made long ago. I owned the emoji domain for quite a while before I finally had the perfect content for it, lol. Current site has been up since September 2019.

I recently updated it to use `:has` and CSS variables for the color of the octopuses. This removed a couple of lines of JS and reduced ~90 lines of CSS so far. Hoping to reduce some more; we'll see.
